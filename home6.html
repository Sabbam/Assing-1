<p class="lead text-success">Great personalities are not born every day; they are born once in a century and are remembered for millennials to come. One such great personality that we will always be proud of is Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. His full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, born in Rameswaram of Madras Presidency on 15th October 1931 and died on July 27, 2015, Shillong. He was an Indian Scientist and also a politician leader, who later became the 11th President of India. He played an important role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons program.</p>
<p class="lead text-light">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (About this soundlisten); 15 October 1931 – 27
                July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to
                2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He
                spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
                involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came
                to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch
                vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in
                India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
